# Workspace-Utilization-Analysis

This project analyzes meeting room booking data to uncover usage patterns, capacity mismatches, and operational inefficiencies. The goal is to transform raw booking data into actionable insights that support better workplace and space optimization decisions.

## Business Problem

Organizations collect large volumes of meeting room booking data but often lack visibility into how effectively their spaces are actually being used. This results in overbooked small rooms, underutilized large rooms, frequent overcapacity events, poorly attended meetings, and scheduling pressure during peak hours.

This project addresses the challenge of converting raw meeting-room booking data into clear, actionable insights that help workplace teams optimize room availability, improve space planning, and make data-driven decisions about expanding, reducing, or repurposing meeting spaces.

## Project Objective

- Measure overall meeting room utilization
- Identify overused and underused rooms
- Detect capacity mismatches between room size and attendance
- Understand peak demand periods by hour, day, and month
- Analyze meeting duration patterns and inefficiencies
- Provide data-backed recommendations for workspace optimization

---

## Tools & Techniques Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformations
- Derived metrics and flags
- Excel slicers for interactivity
- Dashboard design for stakeholder reporting

---

## Key Analyses Performed

- **Room-level utilization analysis**
- **Floor-level utilization comparison**
- **Hourly meeting demand analysis**
- **Day-of-week meeting trends**
- **Monthly meeting volume analysis**
- **Room size category utilization**
- **Capacity mismatch analysis (Attendees vs Room Capacity)**
- **Meeting duration analysis by meeting type**
- **Barely attended meetings (utilization < 25%)**
- **Long meetings (> 90 minutes)**
- **Back-to-back meeting detection**

---

## Dashboard Features

- KPI summary (Total Meetings, Average Utilization, Overcapacity %, Barely Attended %)
- Interactive slicers for:
  - Room Name
  - Floor
  - Room Size Category
  - Meeting Type
- Pivot-based charts connected dynamically to slicers
- Clean, business-friendly layout designed for decision-makers

---

## Key Insights

- Small rooms experience the highest overcapacity pressure
- Large rooms are frequently underutilized relative to capacity
- Peak meeting demand occurs during mid-day and mid-week
- A noticeable share of meetings are barely attended
- Long and back-to-back meetings reduce room availability during peak periods
- Certain meeting types consistently consume more total room time

---

## Recommendations

- Repurpose underutilized large rooms into small or medium rooms
- Encourage right-sized room selection through booking policies
- Introduce buffer times to reduce back-to-back booking congestion
- Shift non-critical meetings to off-peak hours
- Redesign room distribution based on actual usage patterns

## Files Included

- `Analysis + Dashboard.xlsx`  
  Contains cleaned data, pivot tables, charts, and the interactive dashboard.
