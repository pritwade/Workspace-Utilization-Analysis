# Workspace-Utilization-Analysis

This project analyzes meeting room booking data to identify usage patterns, inefficiencies, and opportunities to optimize workspace utilization. The analysis was built entirely in Excel using pivot tables, charts, slicers, and dashboards.

## Objective
To transform raw meeting-room booking data into actionable insights that support workplace planning and space optimization decisions.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Power Query (data cleaning & transformations)
- Excel Slicers
- Dashboard Design

## Key Analysis Areas
- Room-level utilization and overcapacity
- Floor-level demand patterns
- Hourly and day-of-week meeting trends
- Monthly meeting volume
- Capacity vs attendance mismatch analysis
- Meeting duration analysis
- Barely-attended meetings (utilization < 25%)
- Long meetings (> 90 minutes)
- Back-to-back meeting detection

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive slicers (Room, Floor, Meeting Type, Room Size)
- KPI summary metrics
- Utilization and demand visualizations
- Operational inefficiency indicators

## Key Insights
- Small rooms face the highest overcapacity pressure
- Large rooms are frequently underutilized
- Peak demand occurs mid-week and mid-day
- A significant portion of meetings use less than 25% of room capacity
- Long and back-to-back meetings reduce room availability during peak hours

## Recommendations
- Repurpose underutilized large rooms into small/medium rooms
- Add booking system nudges for right-sized room selection
- Introduce buffer times between back-to-back meetings
- Encourage off-peak scheduling for non-critical meetings

## File
- `Analysis + Dashboard.xlsx` – contains cleaned data, pivots, charts, and dashboard
